This repository will house my reinforcement learning code and projects as I develop them.

## [Temporal Difference Learning tic-tac-toe agent](https://github.com/jfpettit/reinforcement-learning/tree/master/TD_tictactoe)
This folder contains files for the tic-tac-toe playing agent and for the tic-tac-toe game. I wrote this code while reading through [Sutton and Barto's "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction"](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html). Chapter 1, section 5 discusses some of the details of developing a tic-tac-toe playing agent, and my code is based off of that section. I tried to write the agent in a general way so that anyone can use it. Full demo of using the code to train and play against the agent coming soon.
