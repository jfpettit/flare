Welcome to flare's documentation!
---------------------------------

Flare was written to be a modular reinforcement learning library.

Find the full contents of the :ref:`flare-package-contents`.

.. _flare: ./source/flare

``flare`` is a small reinforcement learning library. Currently, the use
case for this library is small-scale RL experimentation/research. Much
of the code is refactored from and built off of
`SpinningUp <https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/>`__, so massive
thanks to them for writing quality, understandable, and performant code.
